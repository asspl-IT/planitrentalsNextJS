Pay attention to how it was packaged when you received it and put the items back the same way.  Remove any remaining product from the fountain and clean the parts in soapy water.  If product (chocolate) is left in the machine, it hardens and makes it very difficult to clean (resulting in a cleaning fee).  Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Operating Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>It is highly recommended that you melt the chocolate/product before putting it into the machine.  Although the fountain itself does heat, it will take it a very long time to melt your product down.  So, we recommend putting the product in a bowl and microwaving it (short intervals stirring often) or melting it in a pot on the stove, stirring often.<br>\n<br>\nTo assemble the fountain:<br>\n*Screw the bowl onto the base of the machine.  Do not over-tighten.<br>\n*Screw the towers onto the bowl.  The tower is reverse threaded and has very fine threads.  Please do not use excessive force or try turning it the wrong direction.  Turn it counter-clockwise to screw it onto the bowl, clockwise to unscrew.<br>\n*Gently drop the auger through the tower and rotate it by hand until you feel it drop onto the shaft of the motor.<br>\n*Attach the top tier to the tower and give it a slight rotation to lock it in place.<br>\n<br>\nTroubleshooting:<br>\n*If your product is not flowing, it is because it isn��t hot enough (the product thins as it gets hotter) or needs oil added to it.  We recommend adding a half cup of oil per 2lbs of chocolate.<br>\n*If the product isn��t flowing evenly around the towers, the machine needs to be leveled.  There are little feet on the bottom of the base that can be adjusted to level the fountain\n<br>\n*If the product is not reaching the top tier, it is either because it is too thick, or the intake at the bottom of the towers is clogged.  Turn the machine off, scrape away the product from the base of the tower, and then try again.\n<br><br>\nClosely monitor the temperature of the fountain.  You��ll want to occasionally stir the product in the bowl, and you want to make sure the product doesn��t thicken - but also doesn��t burn.<br>\n<br>\nTo cleanup the machine:<br>\n*Turn the machine off and then scoop out as much remaining product as possible.<br>\n*Allow the machine to cool, and then disassemble the machine (remember the tower is reverse threaded).<br>\n*Run all parts (except the base/motor, please wipe that clean) under hot, soapy water. <br>\n*Put all parts carefully back away into the provided storage container, making sure that the parts aren��t scraping and banging against each other.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Add-on Items</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In order to prepare your add-on items, please place your order 2-3 business days prior to your reservation.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2lb Milk Chocolate $15 (serves 12-26 people with 3-5 dips)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 Skewers $5</span></p>",

If we are unable to rent the item to another customer, 100% of the deposit can be used as a future credit on any rental, and on any item! An additional deposit must still be collected to reserve another item, and the credit will be used on the remaining balance that is due at pickup.\r\nIf a reservation is cancelled after 9:00am the day PRIOR to your pickup day (24 hours before reservation), then 100% of the deposit is forfeited (no refund and no issued credit). In case of inclement weather, the 24hr cancellation policy will be waived and the deposit can be used as a future credit (unless we are able to re-rent the items to another customer, then a full refund will be issued). It is suggested that you arrange an alternate, indoor location for your event in case of weather.

Be mindful of other items on your order, though, when considering space in your vehicle, and make sure seat and cargo space is available. We do ask that you return your bounce house clean and dry. Please leave your blower on until your unit is dry. A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. &nbsp;We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying. Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please put the bounce house away when it is not being used. Leaving it out and unattended may result in damage from unexpected weather, pets, or other unforeseen circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rain or sprinkler systems also often catch people off-guard and then result in the bounce house getting wet without time to adequately dry it back out.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are required to bring help to unload the unit when using the after hours return option.

Be mindful of other items on your order, though, when considering space in your vehicle, and make sure seat and trunk space is available. We do ask that you return your bounce house clean and dry. Please leave your blower on until your unit is dry. A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. &nbsp;We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying. Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please put the bounce house away when it is not being used. Leaving it out and unattended may result in damage from unexpected weather, pets, or other unforeseen circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rain or sprinkler systems also often catch people off-guard and then result in the bounce house getting wet without time to adequately dry it back out.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are required to bring help to unload the unit when using the after hours return option. We require you to stack high and in specific locations so that there is space for everyone. Because of that, it will normally require more than 1 person. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Instructional Video</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6DkhovLffVc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://youtu.be/6DkhovLffVc</span></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Add-on Items</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tarp $5</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plastic Play Balls 200 for $5 or 600 for $10</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generator $40</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extension Cord $5</span></p>",

To operate the machine, place ice cubes in the top.  We've found bigger, hard (solidly frozen), and rounded ice cubes produce the best product, but the machine will shave up any ice you throw in the top.  If the ice is soft and melting, the machine will produce ice more like slush than snow. Place a cup or bowl beneath the output, and then press down on the lid to turn on the machine.  Please note that the machine is quite loud!</p>\r\n<p>To clean the machine, rinse with HOT water until all ice particles are melted, and then dry thoroughly!  If all of the ice isn't melted and dried from the machine, it will cause rust - resulting in poor operation and dulled blades.  This is a very simple cleaning process, so we ask you please do your part to keep our machines in good working order!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Add-on Items</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>In order to prepare your add-on items, please place your order 2-3 business days prior to your reservation</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syrup $5 a liter (serves 20-40)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syrup flavors: Tiger's Blood, Blue Raspberry, Bahama Mama, Wild Cherry, Pina Colada, Lemon-Lime, Root Beer, Dreamsycle, Polar Punch, Banana, Blue Hawaiian, Mango, Pink Lemonade, Pink Bubble Gum, Cola, Grape, Strawberry, Watermelon, and Blue Cotton Candy.

We ask that you return the machine in the same condition you received it. Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to program the remote:<br>Press the menu button until “L - - H” appears on the screen.  Press and hold the “A” button on the remote, until “A001” appears on the screen.  Note: this may turn off the machine, so if the yellow light isn’t solid or blinking - press the “A” button on the remote to turn it back on.<br><br>How to operate:<br>The machine will take up to 5 minutes to heat.  The current temperature of the machine will be displayed on the screen.  It will need to heat over 500 in order to be “Ready.”  A blinking yellow light indicates the machine is “Not Ready” and a solid yellow light will indicate the machine is “Ready” when it is heated above 500.  The machine can not be fired until the yellow light is solid.  If there is no yellow light, the machine has been turned off by the remote.  Press the “A” button on the remote to turn it back on.<br>Multiple machines can be programmed to 1 remote.  Follow the procedure above for each machine, but make sure the other machines are turned off with the red power switch while programming.  Keep in mind that each machine needs to receive a signal to “Fire” so if all machines are operating on 1 remote and 1 machine doesn’t get the signal, it won’t fire with the others.  If you don’t have separate operators for each machine and need to do multiple machines at once with 1 remote - we recommend standing far away from the machines with each machine slightly turned to your position so the remote is essentially pointing at each machine at the same time.  You will want to test this to ensure your location signals each machine simultaneously.<br>“A” button:  Turns the machine on and off.  If you see a yellow blinking or solid light on the back of the machine, the machine is on.  Otherwise it is off.<br>“B” button: Turns on and off low firing mode.<br>“C” button: Turns on and off medium firing mode.<br>“D” button: Turns on and off high firing mode.<br><br>Safety:<br>*Do not carry or move the machines while they are plugged in and powered on.<br>*Make sure there is nothing flammable above or below or around each machine.<br>*The machines get hot!  Do not touch them until they have cooled for several minutes.<br>*Only used cold spark powder provided by Plan-it Rentals.  Other powders may cause damage.<br>*Keep people away from the sparks, and do not allow horseplay around the machines.<br>*If machines are on, they must have constant supervision.  Otherwise turn them off.<br>*Do not shoot sparks for more than 1 minute straight, otherwise it will damage the motor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Add-on Items</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>In order to prepare your add-on items, please place your order 2-3 business days prior to your reservation.</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spark Powder $15 (5 minutes of sparks)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extension Cord $5</span></p>",
