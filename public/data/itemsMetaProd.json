Please leave your blower on until your unit is dry. A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying.

Be mindful of other items on your order, though, when considering space in your vehicle, and make sure seat and cargo space is available. We do ask that you return your bounce house clean and dry. Please leave your blower on until your unit is dry. A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying. Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please put the bounce house away when it is not being used. Leaving it out and unattended may result in damage from unexpected weather, pets, or other unforeseen circumstances.

Be mindful of other items on your order, though, when considering space in your vehicle, and make sure seat and cargo space is available. We do ask that you return your bounce house clean and dry. Please leave your blower on until your unit is dry. A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying. Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please put the bounce house away when it is not being used. Leaving it out and unattended may result in damage from unexpected weather, pets, or other unforeseen circumstances. Rain or sprinkler systems also often catch people off-guard and then result in the bounce house getting wet without time to adequately dry it back out.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are required to bring help to unload the unit when using the after hours return option.

When using two blowers, each blower needs to be on a separate electrical circuit or you may burn up the blower and/or trip your breaker.  Often all outdoor outlets are on the same circuit, so you may need to run an extension cord inside to get a different circuit.  We have extension cords available to rent for $5.  When using extension cords, they must be thick heavy duty cords.<br><br>If your bounce house is not inflating, please watch the instructional video again!.  You need to make sure you are using all blowers given to you, and that you have zipped up all zippers around the bounce house (there could be up to 3 zippers).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Add-on Items</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tarp $5</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plastic Play Balls 100 for $3, we recommend 800 for a full ball pit.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generator $40</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extension Cord $5</span></p>",

A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying. Your efforts will help us keep our pricing low and our service great!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please put the bounce house away when it is not being used. Leaving it out and unattended may result in damage from unexpected weather, pets, or other unforeseen circumstances. Rain or sprinkler systems also often catch people off-guard and then result in the bounce house getting wet without time to adequately dry it back out.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are required to bring help to unload the unit when using the after hours return option. We require you to stack high and in specific locations so that there is space for everyone. Because of that, it will normally require more than 1 person. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Operating Instructions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Please watch the following video:<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6DkhovLffVc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://youtu.be/6DkhovLffVc</span></a><br><br>This bouncer may require two blowers for operation, and the short yellow deflation tube may be used for the second blower.

Please leave your blower on until your unit is dry. A reasonable effort should be made to dry the bounce house if it is used wet (the videos give you more detail on this), and if a tarp is rented from us it should be hung to dry also. Please sweep out grass, pick up candy wrappers, wipe spots with a damp rag, etc. We want to spend our efforts on sanitizing the equipment, not the general cleaning and drying.

You will also need a good source of power, as the foam machine and the solution pump each require power from a standard household outlet.

If you use our stand, assemble the \"T\" bar on top of the tripod, and then slide the foam machine onto the \"T\" bar through the handle of the machine.  When using our stand, please don't over-tighten any of the knobs, it will strip out the threading.  They only need to be snug.<br>2. Fill the provided barrel with water.  Add the foam solution to the water, and stir for 1-2 minutes.<br>3. Connect the foam machine to the solution pump using a standard garden hose.  The hose should not be longer than 50ft.<br>4. Set the solution pump at the bottom of the barrel.  First plug in and turn on the foam machine.  Then plug in the solution pump to turn it on.<br>5. It is advised to unplug the solution pump as the foam builds up.

If you desire to move the foam around or blow it around, please rent our extra blower for $10.<br>7. Once finished, please rinse and dry out the barrel.  Also rinse and dry off the stand.

Dump the scoop into the middle of the machine head, and immediately start rotating the paper cone above the machine to gather the product.  Continue to rotate the cone until the floss has stopped producing.<br>7. Every 30 minutes (while the machine is still running and hot) pour 3-5 scoops full of water into the head of the machine to steam clean it.  HOT STEAM will come out of the machine, so please use caution and be prepared. It is important to do this every 30 minutes to keep the machine clean and functioning properly.  Wait 2-3 minutes after steam cleaning before resuming normal operation of the machine.  There is no need to dry out the machine or the bowl until you are completely finished using the machine.<br>8. When finished making cotton candy, clean the bowl and dome top.  Do not attempt to clean out the machine head.  You may wipe down the cabinet of the machine as needed.<br><br>CAUTION:  The head of the machine and base of the machine gets very hot.  Allow the machine adequate time to cool before moving and packing up the machine.",
